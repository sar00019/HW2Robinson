# Project Overview:
My project is in its preliminary stages to aid homeowners in finding a place to live with a climate that best represents their lifestyle. 
# Page Descriptions:
My home page features a welcome heading with an additional heading and link to direct to the next page. The next page, labeled “Climate Data” includes two headings, a formatted table, and a button designed with JavaScript. There are CSS and Bootstrap additions on both pages to add details that draw the eye and pleasantly welcome the user. 
# Research Summary:
# Research (Homeowner Specific):
Similar Websites:
1a. https://en.climate-data.org/
2a. https://climatecheck.com/
3a. https://climatetoolbox.org/

1b. As I interacted with this website and selected different options, the URL changed to include dashes and what I assume to be the port number. The port number is the gateway for the client (user) to interact with the web browser via server processes. 
2b. After entering “Morgantown, West Virginia” into the search bar, the URL updated to https://climatecheck.com/report?address=Morgantown%2C%20West%20Virginia%2C%20United%20States. The results queried a report, which prompted a question mark, the input, numbers, and percentage symbols, to be added to the URL. 
3b. Once playing around with the various tools offered on this site, there wasn’t much of an adjustment to the URL besides a couple of added dashes and the tool selected.

1c. I recognized lots of JavaScript usage, but not necessarily any Bootstrap inclusions. The colors and tables on the page appeared to be named customarily. This code was the most difficult to read out of the three because it included the greatest amount of information that was hard to decipher. For example, there was an entire paragraph about style that was very harsh on the eyes.
2c. I recognized both JavaScript and Bootstrap in this code. The details to make this website more pleasing to the users’ sight undoubtedly used Bootstrap code to do so. “Linear gradient” gave me the first clue. 
3c. This website had the most conclusive and readable code. I recognized most, if not all lines of code belonging to JavaScript and Bootstrap. Many distinguishable source/src lines addressed Bootstrap. 

1d. This website is much more user-friendly than the original NOAA Climate Normals page. There were lots of colors to draw the user’s eye to what they were looking for, and the charts provided were easy to read. However, I will not be including the pop-ups asking if I’m going on a trip, seemingly scheduled every five seconds. Overall, I would give this website a 7.5/10.
2d. I strongly approve of the functionality of this site. I appreciate the emphasis on homeowner searching, as that is my core focus. Prospective homeowners can greatly benefit from this site, and I am going to use this page as my main inspiration. I think this website best exemplifies my vision and I am most looking forward to implementing a search bar like the one demonstrated in class. I’m giving this site a 9/10. A nine, because I’m not a huge fan of the advertisements. 
3d. This is the best website out of the three I selected; Not necessarily for what I’m imagining for my website, but because there are so many options to choose from regarding what the user is looking for. It includes pages of tools that are easy to use, and I wish I were skilled enough to implement that for my website. Since I’m not advanced enough in my studies to incorporate a plethora of interactive tools on my website, I am going to use the design/formatting of the main page as inspiration. I found that the colors and images used were most familiar to me after using the “inspect” feature because we’ve gone over how to add these to a site in class. I’ll give this website an 8.5/10. 

# GitHub Repo Research:
1a. https://github.com/ehesch/tempestry
2a. https://github.com/zabir-nabil/weather-dashboard
1b. This GitHub repository uses JavaScript to create a colorful chart of climate data dating back 100 years. The code includes both daily and annual data and presents it utilizing warming stripes. “Warming stripes are data visualization graphics that chronologically portray temperature trends.” (1) The README provides examples of how to create a poster/chart using the code the author wrote. 
2b. The author of this HTML code and README presents a weather dashboard that allows the user to input a city and country into a search bar to receive a report of forecasts like the way a typical weather application would function. Additionally, it supplies clothing recommendations, heatwave warnings, temperatures, wind statuses, etc. on the first page. Once diving further, the user can see storm warnings, the duration, and the confidence of those storms. Worldwide precipitation is also given, as well as weather status (i.e. cloudy, rainy, etc.) The README includes a YouTube video of its full functionality that makes it easy for the user to understand how to use this code. 
# Future Enhancements: 
I will be adding a search bar, graphs, pictures, and a lot more functionality. I would like to add a hyperlink to reference the tools on the third website because my website is 10 times more boring without it. I most likely will not be creating another climate-based website, unless it’s for an assignment.

# Reflection on Resources:
The most difficult part of this assignment was finding appropriate GitHub repositories that applied to my topic. Other than that, I had fun making my website!
I used AI once to create the button using JavaScript. I tried figuring it out using w3schools, but I found it was easiest and most effective to use ChatGPT. W3schools helped me throughout this assignment, and I am incredibly grateful for that resource. The YouTube video provided in the email sent to our class was exceptionally helpful as well. Thank you!
